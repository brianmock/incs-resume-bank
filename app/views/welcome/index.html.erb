  <p class="main-content"><em>Presented by</em> <a href="https://www.incschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Heather-Calomese-bio.pdf">Heather Calomese</a>, Director of Specialized Instruction, UNO Charter School Network</p>

  <p class="main-content">Managing your special education classroom is like performing the job of an air traffic controller.  Special Education settings can be busy and distracting, which is not the environment that we want with our population of students. How can teachers effectively manage the traffic of their classroom while protecting the learning environment? How do teachers effectively plan and execute transitions?  How do we effectively communicate with the adults and students to ensure learning occurs?  This mini workshop will help participants understand the importance of communication, routines, and planning that will ensure classroom time is maximized and students are engaged.</p>

  <p class="main-content">In this session, we will define and describe what oracy means and explore how oral language drives both language and literacy development.
